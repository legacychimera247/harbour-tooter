## About
Tooter is Mastodon client for [Sailfish OS](https://sailfishos.org).

This fork continues the work done by molan, thanks! primary distribution is through obs/chum but build actions on github provide a build here on github with every release. As soon as migration code for sailjail paths is implemented, tooter will make it to the harbour!
